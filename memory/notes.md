# Notes — durable facts (update when they change)

## Player
- Astra · ally 145357294 · Kyber 3 (→ Kyber 2) · ~14M GP · 326 chars (314 G13+), 69 ships (10 capitals).
- 9 GLs: JMK, JML, SEE, SLKR, GL Leia, Lord Vader, GL Rey, Jabba, GL Ahsoka.

## Gaps (biggest upgrades)
- **Squad GL: GL Hondo** — leads #1 3v3 defensive wall (38% hold) + several top-4 3v3 walls. Not owned.
- **Fleet: Profundity** (CAPITALPROFUNDITY) — #1 defensive fleet (77% attacker win). Not owned. (Owns Raddus, a different ship.)
- **Non-GL wall: Third Sister** — highest-Hold% team you can't field.

## Board (Kyber, 2026-07)
- 5v5: 11 def squads + 3 fleets. 3v3: 15 def squads + 3 fleets.

## swgoh.gg season alternation
- Even season = 5v5, odd = 3v3. As of 2026-07: S80=5v5 (current), S79=latest 3v3.

## GL allocation (defense-first, but reserve attack GLs)
- Offense always: JMK, JML, SEE, SLKR. 5v5 also GL Leia (96% #1 attacker).
- Defense: Lord Vader, GL Rey, GL Ahsoka, Jabba (+ GL Leia in 3v3).

## Fleets (grounded caps from /gac/ship-counters; reinforcements = faction meta from owned ships)
- Defense: Leviathan (81%), Negotiator (87%), Home One (90%).
- Offense: Executor, Malevolence, Raddus.
- All 6 fleets share no ship (single-use). Malevolence fleet = 6 ships (all owned Separatist).

## HotUtils
- API base api.hotutils.com/Production ; squads/list, squads/upsert (create via {definition}, delete via {id,void:true}).
- Categories are free strings → used 6: GAC {5v5,3v3} - {Defense,Offense} + GAC Fleet - {Defense,Offense}.
- Session ids are ephemeral — recapture each session (browser_recipes.md §4).

## Mod optimizer (Grandivory via HotUtils) — DONE 2026-07-19
- Path: HotUtils → GI's Optimizer (/mods/optimizer) → embeds mods-optimizer.swgoh.grandivory.com (or open standalone tab). Priority = selected-character order; use-case = GAC (via Auto-generate List).
- Two views/tabs on the app: "Optimize my mods" is a NAV TAB (no-op for compute); the real run button is "Optimize my mods!" (with `!`) at the bottom of the selection/edit view. Don't confuse them.
- **STALE-DATA GOTCHA:** "Move mods in-game" fails mid-batch with **"Error! Row not found!"** when HotUtils' cached game state is old (a mod isn't where HU thinks). FIX = on the optimizer, "Fetch my data!" → "Fetch with HotUtils" → "Fetch my data" (pulls fresh current inventory into HU AND the optimizer), THEN re-run "Optimize my mods!" (fresh recompute), THEN "Move mods in-game".
- **Partial-apply reality:** a "Row not found" failure applies moves up to the failing row. First attempt implied ~6.39M credits / 1,259 moves; after fresh retry the remaining diff was only **1,710,000 credits** → confirms ~¾ applied on the first (errored) pass. Re-fetch always reflects the true post-partial state, so re-optimizing from there is correct.
- Apply "can take several minutes" and **logs the account out of GoH**; success dialog = "Mods successfully moved". Completed cleanly 2026-07-19 on fresh 2,234-mod inventory.

## Mod upgrade/slice/calibrate via HotUtils API — DONE 2026-07-20
Endpoints (POST api.hotutils.com/Production/, body has {sessionId,...}; header apiuserid stable 898a36a3-948a-4a8a-9798-7a1552b042a8; sessionId rotates — recapture from a live XHR each session):
- **Slice / promote a tier:** `mods/tier {modIds:[id,...], getAllData:true}` — advances each mod ONE tier (5E→…→5A→6E→…→6A). rc 1 = "MODS TIERED". ⚠️ **`simulation:true` is NOT a dry run — it really slices.** Never trust it; every call is real.
- **Level to 15 ("upgrade"):** `mods/level {modIds:[id,...], requestType:3}` (3=ToMax, 4=SingleLevel). Credits only. **Slicing REQUIRES level 15** — level sub-15 mods first or `mods/tier` errors.
- **Calibrate (6-dot):** `mods/reroll {modId, stat:5}` (stat 5 = Speed) → returns `.mod` preview → `mods/acceptreroll {keepMod:true|false}`. Reverting (false) costs nothing; per-mod charges are LIMITED (≈tier count) and errors when exhausted → **continue to next mod, don't global-stop**. Not gated by tracked materials. **DAILY CAP:** after ~30 reroll attempts the game service returns `responseCode 2 / "GOHServiceCall Error [40]"` on EVERY reroll (not a rapid rate-limit — persists past a 20s pause). This is SWGOH's daily calibration limit; resets at daily payout (nextPayoutUTC, ~07:00 Athens). Resume calibration next day. `mods/level` and reads are unaffected by the cap.
- Data model: `account/data/all` → d.data.mods.mods[] {id, unit.baseId(equipped) , rarity(dots 5/6), tier(1=E..5=A/gold), level, setId(4=Speed set), slot, secondaryStat[].stat.unitStatId(5=Speed, ÷10000)}. Materials at d.data.material.material[] by id.
Material recipe (per tier-step) + binding constraints, from live diffs:
- 6-dot slice-up: ~T06_02×20 (BINDS), +T06_01/03, +T05_05/06×10, ~130-160K cr. → ~19-20 steps per full stock.
- 5A→6E promote: PROMO_T5_T6×20 + T05_05×50 + **T05_06×50 (BINDS)** + 200K cr.
- 5-dot slice to 5A: **T05_03 (5C→5B) + T05_04 (5B→5A) BIND**; T05_01/02 for the low steps.
Session result: 72→**81 6A** (+9: Jabba, Rey, Lord Vader, 3×Darth Revan, 2×JKR, Ahsoka), +5 promotes to 6E (Starkiller, Bastila, Ezra, 2×JKR), Rey calibrated 23→26 spd, +15 mods to 5A. Stopped at true material exhaustion (T06_02=3, T05_06=15, T05_03=6, T05_04=27); leftover T05_01/02/05 + PROMO are stranded (need the depleted tiers to complete a chain). ~7M credits spent. Priority = defense-squad chars → offense → rest, by speed secondary (scripts/slice_plan.py → output/slice_queue.json).
