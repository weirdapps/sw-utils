# Notes — durable facts (update when they change)

## Player
- Astra · ally 145357294 · Kyber 3 (→ Kyber 2) · ~14M GP · 326 chars (314 G13+), 69 ships (10 capitals).
- 9 GLs: JMK, JML, SEE, SLKR, GL Leia, Lord Vader, GL Rey, Jabba, GL Ahsoka.

## Gaps (biggest upgrades)
- **Squad GL: GL Hondo** — leads #1 3v3 defensive wall (38% hold) + several top-4 3v3 walls. Not owned.
- **Fleet: Profundity** (CAPITALPROFUNDITY) — #1 defensive fleet (77% attacker win). Not owned. (Owns Raddus, a different ship.)
- **Non-GL wall: Third Sister** — highest-Hold% team you can't field.

## Board (Kyber, 2026-07)
- 5v5: 11 def squads + 3 fleets. 3v3: 15 def squads + 3 fleets.

## swgoh.gg season alternation
- Even season = 5v5, odd = 3v3. As of 2026-07: S80=5v5 (current), S79=latest 3v3.

## GL allocation (defense-first, but reserve attack GLs)
- Offense always: JMK, JML, SEE, SLKR. 5v5 also GL Leia (96% #1 attacker).
- Defense: Lord Vader, GL Rey, GL Ahsoka, Jabba (+ GL Leia in 3v3).

## Fleets (grounded caps from /gac/ship-counters; reinforcements = faction meta from owned ships)
- Defense: Leviathan (81%), Negotiator (87%), Home One (90%).
- Offense: Executor, Malevolence, Raddus.
- All 6 fleets share no ship (single-use). Malevolence fleet = 6 ships (all owned Separatist).

## HotUtils
- API base api.hotutils.com/Production ; squads/list, squads/upsert (create via {definition}, delete via {id,void:true}).
- Categories are free strings → used 6: GAC {5v5,3v3} - {Defense,Offense} + GAC Fleet - {Defense,Offense}.
- Session ids are ephemeral — recapture each session (browser_recipes.md §4).

## Mod optimizer (Grandivory via HotUtils) — DONE 2026-07-19
- Path: HotUtils → GI's Optimizer (/mods/optimizer) → embeds mods-optimizer.swgoh.grandivory.com (or open standalone tab). Priority = selected-character order; use-case = GAC (via Auto-generate List).
- Two views/tabs on the app: "Optimize my mods" is a NAV TAB (no-op for compute); the real run button is "Optimize my mods!" (with `!`) at the bottom of the selection/edit view. Don't confuse them.
- **STALE-DATA GOTCHA:** "Move mods in-game" fails mid-batch with **"Error! Row not found!"** when HotUtils' cached game state is old (a mod isn't where HU thinks). FIX = on the optimizer, "Fetch my data!" → "Fetch with HotUtils" → "Fetch my data" (pulls fresh current inventory into HU AND the optimizer), THEN re-run "Optimize my mods!" (fresh recompute), THEN "Move mods in-game".
- **Partial-apply reality:** a "Row not found" failure applies moves up to the failing row. First attempt implied ~6.39M credits / 1,259 moves; after fresh retry the remaining diff was only **1,710,000 credits** → confirms ~¾ applied on the first (errored) pass. Re-fetch always reflects the true post-partial state, so re-optimizing from there is correct.
- Apply "can take several minutes" and **logs the account out of GoH**; success dialog = "Mods successfully moved". Completed cleanly 2026-07-19 on fresh 2,234-mod inventory.
